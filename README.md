# ðŸš€ SpaceX Machine Learning Prediction
This Capstone Project for IBM's Data Science Certification goes through the stages of Data Science with the objective of creating a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage of SpaceX rocket launches will land successfully. In this project, I webscraped using BeautifulSoup and gathered information about the launch locations and payloads and successes and failures. I data wrangled and analyzed, and put together visualizations including maps. I built an interactive dashboard about the launches. And finally, I trained and tested machine learning models to find that the best prediction method was the Decision Tree, with accuracy 0.8889.
